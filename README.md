LEGO-dataset

The LEGO challenge was pitched by a teacher at the the Hague university of applied sciences. 
The idea was that there would be an app that poeple could use to search for a specific LEGO brick in a pile of bricks. 
The use of machine learning was not mandatory for this challenge, however it was seen as the most likely course of action.
Several routes have been considered and looked into and eventually tensorflow seemed to be the best option because a lot of information could be found on it and therefore it seemed to be fairly beginner friendly.
This was very important for us as non of us had any experience with machine learning or AI for that matter.
