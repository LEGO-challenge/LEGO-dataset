You know the find your brick april fools joke from LEGO? We tried to make that fool realaty. We came across some obstacles, and we would like to share our finds. 

The LEGO challenge was pitched by a teacher at the the Hague university of applied sciences. The idea was that there would be an app that poeple could use to search for a specific LEGO brick in a pile of bricks. The use of machine learning was not mandatory for this challenge, however it was seen as the most likely course of action. Several routes have been considered and looked into and eventually tensorflow seemed to be the best option because a lot of information could be found on it and therefore it seemed to be fairly beginner friendly. This was very important for us as non of us had any experience with machine learning or AI for that matter.

To train the object detection model the notebook linked in this website has been used: https://medium.com/swlh/tensorflow-2-object-detection-api-with-google-colab-b2af171e81cc It has been altered somewhat for it to work with our dataset. This is only the tip of the iceberg though as most of our time and effort was spent learning about AI and machine learning and figuring out what worked for us and what didn't. For more information check out the 'info' folder (beware most of it will be Dutch).
