### You know the [find your brick April foolâ€™s joke from LEGO](https://twitter.com/LEGO_Group/status/1112625676836880384?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1112625676836880384%7Ctwgr%5E%7Ctwcon%5Es1_&ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fbrickshow.com%2F2019%2F04%2Fa-look-at-legos-april-fools-prank-for-2019%2F "the tweet")? We tried to make that prank reality. There were some obstacles, and we would like to share our finds.

##### The origin
The LEGO challenge was pitched by a teacher at the Hague university of applied sciences. The idea was that there would be an app that people could use to search for a specific LEGO brick in a pile of bricks. The use of machine learning was not mandatory for this challenge, however it was seen as the most likely course of action. Several routes have been considered and investigated and eventually TensorFlow seemed to be the best option because a lot of information could be found on it and therefore it seemed to be fairly beginner friendly. This was very important for us as none of us had any experience with machine learning or AI for that matter.

##### Object detection
To train the object detection model the notebook linked in this website has been used: https://medium.com/swlh/tensorflow-2-object-detection-api-with-google-colab-b2af171e81cc It has been altered somewhat for it to work with our dataset. This is only the tip of the iceberg though as most of our time and effort was spent learning about AI and machine learning and figuring out what worked for us and what didn't. For more information check out the 'info' folder (beware most of it will be Dutch).

##### Classification
Before the object detection model we had a classification model. [This tutorial from codelab](https://codelabs.developers.google.com/codelabs/recognize-flowers-with-tensorflow-on-android#0 "the tutorial") has been used. Starting with a classification model did make this easier in the long run. The first thing that we realized is to make your own dataset. The dataset was consisted of 9 classes with over a thousand pictures of each class. The pictures have been made using the burst mode to make lots of pictures.
